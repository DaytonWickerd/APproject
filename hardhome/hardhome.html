        <p class= "paragraph">Hardhome was a Free Folk fishing village located beyond the Wall on a sheltered bay along the Shivering Sea, situated at the tip of the large peninsula known as Storrold's Point. Many of the Free Folk who survived the Battle of Castle Black and were not captured by the forces of Stannis Baratheon fled to Hardhome.   <br> <br> After the Battle of Castle Black, Lord Commander Jon Snow and Tormund take the Royal Fleet to Hardhome in order to convince the Free Folk there to come back to Castle Black with them.   </p>
